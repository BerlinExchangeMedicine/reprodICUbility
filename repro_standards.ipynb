    "# ReprodICUbility: Open Science and Coding Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to ReprodICUbility! It is a pleasure to have you with us.\n",
    "In this Notebook, we want to provide a guide for implementing best practices in two critical areas: **Open Science** and **Coding Guidelines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Open Science**</u>  \n",
    "As members of the Student Network of Open Science, adhering to open science principles is one of our highest priorities and this Notebook will help operationalize these principles. It aims to offer steps to integrate the at times abstract and lofty ideals of open science into our workflows in a concrete, pragmatic manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Coding Guidelines**</u>  \n",
    "Collaborative work is at the core of our project, making standardized coding practices essential. This section will outline guidelines designed to streamline collaboration by ensuring uniformity in code across teams and throughout the project. Additionally, it will provide recommendations for enhancing code readability and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these guidelines will support our shared goal of developing a robust and reproducible open reproduction pipeline as a team effort.\n"

    "## <u>**[I] Open Science**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>0. Open Ignorance</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Principle**:\n",
    "  - This is a note for our collaboration rather than for the reproduction process itself.\n",
    "  - ReprodICUbility is a large, fast-paced project where diverse backgrounds meet. Naturally, this will lead to questions and uncertainties.\n",
    "- **Practice:**\n",
    "  - _Openly ask every question you have_: a willingness to learn is far more valuable here than trying to appear omniscient!\n",
    "    - If you don’t understand something after paying attention, chances are that half of your collaborators are in the same boat.\n",
    "  - _Share helpful resources_ or explanations whenever you find answers to your questions.\n",
    "  - Encourage a culture where asking for clarification is seen as a contribution to collective understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>1. Accountability</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Principle**:\n",
    "  - Effective collaboration and appropriate crediting require documentation of your contributions to the project.\n",
    "  - Open science starts with transparency among ourselves, not just with what we present the public at the end.\n",
    "  - It is remarkable how much it speeds up team efforts to know precisely whom to ask about a specific decision that was made.\n",
    "    - “What does this variable mean? What statistical assumption is being tested here? Who decided on this or that approach? . . .”\n",
    "- **Practice**:\n",
    "  - _Annotate_ scripts and documents when you make significant alterations or decisions, along with the rationales behind them.\n",
    "  - Maintain a changelog in our shared documents to track who made which changes and why.\n",
    "    - Suggestion: Set up brief but regular _documentation sprints_ where teams review and update project records.\n",
    "  - Regular _check-ins with other teams_: Engage in mutual reviews and exchanges of ideas.\n",
    "    - Articulating your approaches helps identify inconsistencies, often even before others point them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>2. Transparency</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Principle:**\n",
    "  - This may be the heart of classic open science: making all aspects of research accessible, including methods, data, protocols, and results, to enable scrutiny and reuse.\n",
    "- **Practice:**\n",
    "  - _Citation_: Provide full references for all external information, whether from papers, textbooks, or other resources.\n",
    "  - _AI_: Nowadays, most of us use AI in some way. Documenting exactly how and were it was used it, thus, also part of open science practice.\n",
    "  - _Findings_: Report all findings, regardless of whether they align with expectations or are appealing — do not filter evidence.\n",
    "  - _Alternatives_: Acknowledge that there is no single way to build a pipeline as we plan, and record any statistical disputes, alternative methods, and assumptions discussed within the team. Be transparent about which decisions were made, which alternatives were omitted — and why.\n",
    "  - _Platforms_: Use the shared, open-access platforms we provide for storing and sharing data, code, and documentation, ensuring that all team members and external collaborators have access.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Beyond**</u>\n",
    "Fortunately, much of the ReprodICUbility infrastructure inherently supports open science. Using the resources we provide integrates many of the more basic open science practices by design. Here, too, _always ask questions_ if anything about the digital architecture is unclear, unintuitive or posits a hurdle to your work.\n",
    "And after all: Reproducibility itself is one of the major principles of open science :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for your contribution! <3\n"

    "## <u>**[II] Coding Guidelines**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Coding Guidelines will follow two principles: Standardization and Readability. These two obviously go hand in hand in many regards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standardization** simply refers to norms we want to lay down at the beginning of the project. These concern variable and function names, code structure, logging, etc. These standards may seem arbitrary at times — and they are! But we need to standardize format somehow to ensure uniformity across teams and across time, otherwise this whole thing will become a mess very quickly. Thus, we would kindly ask you to adhere to these standards as best as you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Readability** involves general recommendations for streamlining teamwork throughout the project. We all sometimes approach coding nonchalantly with an attitude of: “Who else needs to read this?”. But for our project, readability is key. As a shorthand, you can ask yourself: If you lost your memory of the past days, could you understand your own code from scratch? How much time and effort would that take?\n",

    "### <u>1. **Naming Variables and Functions**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- _ReprodICUbility_: We have noticed in the preparation for this project that the name “ReprodICUbility” is quickly misspelled, which is why we will consistently use its short form _**repro**_ when we need to refer to it in code.\n",
    "- _Necessity_: It is a prominent mistake to optimize something that shouldn’t even exist → Do you really need this new variable/function?\n",
    "  - Whenever a new name or operation is introduced in code, explain its purpose and background in the larger context (see commenting).\n",
    "- _Case Type_: We've decided to exclusively use _**snake_case**_ (i.e., sub-names separated by underscores) instead of camelCase or PascalCase. This is one of these arbitrary standards specified above - it is purely an aesthetic formality that we want to lay down for consistency.\n",
    "- _Clarity_: Try to be _too_ explicit (because you can actually never be too explicit). Make names longer rather than shorter and a bit more obvious than you think necessary at the time. For example:\n",
    "  - Avoid abbreviations.\n",
    "  - Put units in variable names where useful (e.g., `missing_variables_percentage_decimal_notation` or `missing_variables_percentage_percentage_notation`; `delay_time_seconds` or `delay_time_minutes`).\n",

    "While you have all the liberty to create your own branches and work with them, please do never code on the main branch. If you consider your code to be relevant to all course-participants, please consult your teamlead and discuss a pull-request (if you grew up with GitLab - 'merge-request') on the main branch with them.\n",
    "For now, just get used to be working with the study server. After you have decided on how to work together as a team you can create branches with the simple command:\n",
    "git branch <branchname> # Creates the branch\n",
    "git checkout <branchname> # Lets you switch to the branch you need\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have worked on your code and you want to add the changes to the branch you can use:\n",
    "git add <filename> # You may define the files you want to add here\n",
    "After you have added all the files you want to be commited to a commit (kind of a step of documenting your changes) you may run:\n",
    "git commit -m\"<Commit message in which you describe shortly what you have done\"\n",
    "If you are working with several workstations (e.g. personal computer and server) you would push your changes next, so other people can access the data too. This step is not needed, if you are working on the study server all the time.\n",
    "However, for reasons of completeness:\n",
    "git push # This pushes your commits to the origin branch (e.g. on GitHub or GitLab)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please feel free to ask either your teamleads or Rico and Till during the coding office hours if you get stuck with the version control.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Open Science starts with Open Ignorance: _Feel free to ask every question you may have!_\n",
    "- Indicate where _you_ have contributed to the project to facilitate effective communication and credit where it is due.\n",
    "- Freely share ideas and findings within and across teams.\n",
    "- Transparently refer to external resources that you use, such as papers or AI.\n",
    "- Report _everything_ you find and document your decisions for or against certain approaches comprehensibly.\n",
    "- Try to use the digital ReprodICUbility infrastructure, which is organized to support open science by design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Being able to quickly understand one another’s code is essential in this project: try to follow the _standards_ and aim for _readability_.\n",
    "- Name variables and functions _explicitly_. Try not to use abbreviations and provide more detail rather than less (err on the side of “too obvious”).\n",
    "- Prioritize modularity and _avoid nesting_. Implement extraction and inversion to separate the code into easily readable and debuggable chunks.\n",
    "- Use the markdown sections to explain your approach _conceptually_ and comments in code blocks to localize the concepts in concrete _syntax_.\n",
    "- Generally: try coding with _intent_. Code is, after all, a _tool_ — there to implement specific ideas. This applies, for example, to _error handling and logging/print statements_. Use them with purpose to bolster specific, potential weak points or highlight important steps in the process.\n",
    "- Our project runs the risk of producing a lot of code very quickly. This is natural in such a large multi-team endeavour, but ideally we avoid losing the thread in tangled thickets of untargeted, untraceable code.\n",
